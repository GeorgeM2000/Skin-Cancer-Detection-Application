# Skin Cancer Detection Application
 This application focuses on capturing skin lesions using a camera from a mobile device and predicting the related disease. 
 
# Usage
 With this application you can take pictures of any lesions on your skin and clasify them to seven diseases. You can also select an image 
 from your gallery and classify it. Choosing an image from the gallery gives you the ability to pre-process the image in order to have better and more accurate results.
 
# Issues that come with this application
 The machine learning model was trained on the Skin Cancer MNIST : HAM10000 dataset which can be found here <link>https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000</link>
 This dataset uses high quality zoomed pictures of various skin lesions which creates a significant challenge because a mobile phone can't take such high quality pictures.
 Most of the datasets are similar to the above and for that reason this application can't be used for real world applications.
